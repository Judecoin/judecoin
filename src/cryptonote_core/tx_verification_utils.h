/**
 * @brief Cached version of rct::verRctNonSemanticsSimple
 *
 * This function will not affect how the transaction is serialized and it will never modify the
 * transaction prefix.
 *
 * The reference to tx is mutable since the transaction's ring signatures may be expanded by
 * Blockchain::expand_transaction_2. However, on cache hits, the transaction will not be
 * expanded. This means that the caller does not need to call expand_transaction_2 on this
 * transaction before passing it; the transaction will not successfully verify with "old" RCT data
 * if the transaction has been otherwise modified since the last verification.
 *
 * But, if cryptonote::get_transaction_hash(tx) returns a "stale" hash, this function is not
 * guaranteed to work. So make sure that the cryptonote::transaction passed has not had
 * modifications to it since the last time its hash was fetched without properly invalidating the
 * hashes.
 *
 * rct_type_to_cache can be any RCT version value as long as rct::verRctNonSemanticsSimple works for
 * this RCT version, but for most applications, it doesn't make sense to not make this version
 * the "current" RCT version (i.e. the version that transactions in the mempool are).
 *
 * @param tx transaction which contains RCT signature to verify
 * @param mix_ring mixring referenced by this tx. THIS DATA MUST BE PREVIOUSLY VALIDATED
 * @param cache saves tx+mixring hashes used to cache calls
 * @param rct_type_to_cache Only RCT sigs with version (e.g. RCTTypeBulletproofPlus) will be cached
 * @return true when verRctNonSemanticsSimple() w/ expanded tx.rct_signatures would return true
 * @return false when verRctNonSemanticsSimple() w/ expanded tx.rct_signatures would return false
